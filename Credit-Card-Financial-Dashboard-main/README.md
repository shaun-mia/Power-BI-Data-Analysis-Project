# Credit Card Financial Dashboard 💳

This project is a comprehensive analysis of credit card transactions and customer data, focusing on insights derived from two main perspectives: **Transaction Report** and **Customer Report**. The dashboard was created using **SQL** for data storage and manipulation, and **Power BI** for data visualization and analysis. The project integrates real-time data updates, calculated measures, and custom columns to provide actionable insights.

## Project Features 🚀

### 1. SQL Database Creation and Data Upload 📂
- A relational database was designed in SQL to store credit card transaction data and customer data.
- Data was uploaded into the SQL database and updated in real-time to reflect the latest transactions.
- SQL queries were used to clean, transform, and structure the data for optimal use in Power BI.

### 2. Data Modeling and Transformations in Power BI 📊
- Connected to the SQL database via Power BI for real-time data updates.
- Created custom measures and calculated columns to extract deeper insights:
  - **Revenue**, **Total Interest**, **Transaction Amount**, and **Transaction Count** were calculated for both dashboards.
  - Other key measures included **Customer Acquisition Cost** (CAC) and **Sum of Fees**.
- Data transformations were performed to ensure the datasets were optimized for analysis, including the use of **Power Query Editor** for data shaping and cleansing.
