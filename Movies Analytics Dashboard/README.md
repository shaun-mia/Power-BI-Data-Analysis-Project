The dashboard leverages data from multiple tables to create a comprehensive view of movies, including performance metrics like revenue, budget, IMDb ratings, and actor contributions. By using DAX calculations and visualizations, this project helps stakeholders in the movie industry make data-driven decisions.

## DAX Formulas

### **1. Youngest Actor's Birth Year**

This measure calculates the youngest actor's birth year.

```DAX
Youngest Actor Birth Year = MAX(actors[birth_year])
```

### **2. Youngest Actor's Name**

This measure retrieves the name of the youngest actor based on their birth year.

```DAX
Youngest Actor Name = 
VAR YoungestYear = [Youngest Actor Birth Year]
RETURN
CALCULATE(
    FIRSTNONBLANK(actors[name], 1),
    FILTER(
        actors,
        actors[birth_year] = YoungestYear
    )
)
```

### **3. Total Budget Measure**

This measure calculates the total production budget in USD, considering different currencies.

```DAX
Total Budget = 
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    financials[currency] = "INR", financials[budget] * 0.012,  -- Conversion Rate INR to USD
    financials[currency] = "Millions", financials[budget],        -- Already in USD
    financials[currency] = "Billions", financials[budget] * 1000, -- Conversion Rate Billions to Millions
    financials[budget]  -- Default case
)
```

### **4. Revenue in USD Measure**

This measure converts the box office revenue to USD for standard comparison across different currencies (INR, USD, Billions).

```DAX
Revenue in USD = 
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    financials[currency] = "INR", financials[box_office_collection] * 0.012,  -- Conversion Rate INR to USD
    financials[currency] = "Millions", financials[box_office_collection],        -- Already in USD
    financials[currency] = "Billions", financials[box_office_collection] * 1000, -- Conversion Rate Billions to Millions
    financials[box_office_collection]  -- Default case
)
```

### **5. Box Office Collection Measure**

This measure calculates the total box office revenue, considering the currency unit.

```DAX
Total Box Office = 
SUMX(
    financials,
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        financials[currency] = "INR", financials[box_office_collection] * 0.012,  -- INR to USD
        financials[currency] = "Millions", financials[box_office_collection],        -- Already in USD
        financials[currency] = "Billions", financials[box_office_collection] * 1000, -- Billions to Millions
        financials[box_office_collection]  -- Default case
    )
)
```

### **6. Average IMDb Rating Measure**

This measure calculates the average IMDb rating of all movies.

```DAX
Average IMDb Rating = AVERAGE(movies[imdb_rating])
```

### **7. Movies per Actor**

This measure calculates the number of movies each actor has participated in.

```DAX
Movies per Actor = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(movie_actor),

)
```
