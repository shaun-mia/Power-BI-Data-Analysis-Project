## üõ†Ô∏è Key DAX Calculations  

The project extensively uses **DAX expressions** for dynamic calculations and aggregations. Below are some examples:

- **Content by Region**:  
  ```DAX
  India = COUNTROWS(FILTER(netflix_data, netflix_data[country] = "India"))
  USA = COUNTROWS(FILTER(netflix_data, netflix_data[country] = "United States"))
  ```

- **Maximum Duration**:  
  ```DAX
  MaxDuration = MAX(netflix_data[duration])
  ```

- **Movies Percentage**:  
  ```DAX
  MoviesPercentage = DIVIDE(COUNTROWS(FILTER(netflix_data, netflix_data[type] = "Movie")), [TotalContent], 0)
  ```

- **Total Movies and TV Shows**:  
  ```DAX
  Total Movies = COUNTROWS(FILTER(netflix_data, netflix_data[type] = "Movie"))
  Total TVShows = COUNTROWS(FILTER(netflix_data, netflix_data[type] = "TV Show"))
  ```

- **Total Content**:  
  ```DAX
  TotalContent = COUNT(netflix_data[show_id])
  ```
