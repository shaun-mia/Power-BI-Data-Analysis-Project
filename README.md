📊 Power BI Data Analysis Projects

Hello, everyone! 👋 I hope you’re having a great day.

In this repository, I’m excited to share my Power BI Data Analysis Projects, where I’ve transformed raw datasets into meaningful business insights through interactive dashboards and visual storytelling.

These projects reflect my ability to:

Connect and model data from multiple sources

Perform advanced data cleaning and transformation using Power Query

Apply DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated measures and KPIs

Design professional, user-friendly dashboards that support data-driven decision-making

Each project folder includes documentation, visuals, and step-by-step insights into how I approached the analysis — from data preparation to final visualization.
